    <p> Hello! Welcome to the Help Desk system developed by me, a Full Stack Developer.<br /> 
      This is a system for managing tickets, simulating a simple Help Desk, developed with Angular 12 
      and Spring Boot 2.3.12. The main goal of the project is to address concepts such as SPAs (Single Page Applications), 
      Authentication and Authorization with JWT Tokens, and much more. The project's source code can be accessed 
      by clicking on the Github link in the side menu. 
      <br /> Sincerely, Reinaldo Holtz </p>
